# Package Installation

In order to make sure bootcamp runs smoothly, all necessary packages, programs, etc. should be installed (as much as possible) before Day 1. To install all the necessary programs/packages follow the instructions in the accompanied notebook here. In total there are 5 Steps/Sections that need to be completed.

If you run into any issues or have any questions/concerns feel free to shoot me an email: tsears@ucsd.edu
